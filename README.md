# 🛡️ Mr Robot VulnHub Walkthrough
📌 Overview
- This repository documents my complete walkthrough of the Mr Robot vulnerable machine from VulnHub, solved using a structured penetration testing methodology.
- The goal of this lab was to practice web enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation in a controlled environment.

 **⚠️ Disclaimer**
- This project is for educational purposes only.
All testing was performed on a deliberately vulnerable machine in a lab setup.

# 🎯 Objectives

* Perform systematic reconnaissance
* Identify web application weaknesses
* Gain initial system access
* Escalate privileges to root
* Capture all flags

 # 🧰 Tools Used
* Nmap
* Hydra
* Netcat
* John the Ripper
* Linux privilege escalation techniques
* WordPress Theme Editor

# 🖥️ Lab Setup

* Attacker Machine: Kali Linux
* Target Machine: Mr Robot (VulnHub)
* Network Mode: Host-Only Adapter
# 🧠 Key Takeaways

* robots.txt is not a security control
* Weak credentials + admin access = high risk
* WordPress theme editor can lead to RCE
* Unsalted hashes are trivial to crack
* SUID binaries are common privilege escalation vectors

 # 🎓 Skills Demonstrated

* Network & web enumeration
* Exploitation methodology
* Linux privilege escalation
* Real-world pentesting mindset
* Tool + logic based problem solving
